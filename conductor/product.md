# Product Guide

## # Initial Concept
MarkPaste is a web-based utility designed to serve as a comprehensive tool for HTML and Markdown manipulations. It aims to streamline the workflow for developers and LLM users who frequently need to convert, clean, and format rich text and code snippets.

## Target Audience
- **Developers:** Professionals who need to quickly convert documentation, code blocks, or rich text content into clean Markdown for use in repositories, issue trackers, or documentation sites.
- **LLM Users:** Users interacting with Large Language Models who require clean, token-efficient text inputs derived from web content or formatted documents.

## Core Value Proposition
MarkPaste evolves beyond simple conversion by offering a suite of tools for content sanitization and preparation. It bridges the gap between rich text sources (webpages, documents) and text-based environments (IDEs, Markdown editors, LLM prompts) by ensuring content is not just converted, but optimized for its destination.

## Key Features & Goals
- **Robust Rich Text to Markdown:** Reliable conversion that preserves essential formatting while discarding unnecessary artifacts.
- **HTML Cleaning & Sanitization:** dedicated tools to strip unwanted styles, scripts, and classes, producing "clean" HTML that is safe and easy to work with.
- **LLM-Ready Output:** Optimization of output for AI context windows, ensuring clarity and minimal token usage.
- **Visual Feedback:** Real-time preview of both the intermediate HTML and the final Markdown to ensure accuracy.
- **Developer-Centric UX:** A fast, responsive, and local-first web interface that respects privacy and workflow speed.
